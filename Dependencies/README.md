# iPlug 2 Dependencies

Several small 3rd party are included directly with iPlug 2, but there are some things such as plug-in SDKs 
that you have to install.

Other, optional dependencies can be downloaded and built locally using scripts in the IPlug and IGraphics sub-folders. Alternatively, you can download pre-built libraries, that are generated by continuous integration servers.

The subfolder "Build" should contain these built libraries, with sub-folders for each platform.

## macOS

Pre built macOS dependencies can be downloaded here [iplug2_deps_mac.zip](https://github.com/iPlug2/iPlug2/releases/download/setup/iplug2_deps_mac.zip)

and should be extracted so it looks like this...

```
iPlug2/Dependencies/Build/mac/
iPlug2/Dependencies/Build/mac/bin
iPlug2/Dependencies/Build/mac/include
iPlug2/Dependencies/Build/mac/lib
iPlug2/Dependencies/Build/mac/share
```

## Windows

*Coming soon*
