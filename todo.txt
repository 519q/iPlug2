ALL - popupmenu submenus
ALL - resize graphics
ALL - drag & drop area
ALL - OS tooltips?
ALL - make consistent code style
ALL - make side chain/multi-channel definitions consistent/easier
ALL - save fxp/fxb with chunks

Examples:

- IPlugPolySynth
- IPlugSideChain
- IPlugMultiChannel
- IPlugOpenGL on win, fix on mac
- IPlugChunks still needs some work
- IPlugControls - some controls not finished

AU wrapper:

- mono output busess, i.e. for a drumsynth
- preset changing in logic?
- auval "preset name not retained" message

VST3 wrapper:

- midi output
- pitch bend parameters
- sidechain
- presets list?

RTAS wrapper:

- MAC - apple+Q sometimes not passed to PT
- Very occasionally the overlayed cocoa window gets stuck
- WIN - sporadic redraw problem
- check default PT behaviour for IControls
- chunks
- some key press passthrough lost?
- audiosuite
- presets list
- close session frozen buffer (only happens when debugging?)
- SendMidiMsg/s

Standalone wrapper:

- some keys not received by windows standalone...arrow keys for example DLGC_WANTARROWS
- how to change audio devices without hanging the main loop?
- change ASIO device fails
- crash with midi on x64??
- sometimes OSX controls need playing with to get the driver to restart
- fade out audio stream when changing settings?
- make it work with no audio input & look at PLUG_IS_INST
- make it work with variable i/o count
- make it work with non-gui plugins
- transport & tempo generator
- missing functions in IPlugStandalone.h
- windows midi - sendmidimsg() crash
- windows midi - MS Built in GS Synth crashes when selected in prefs (XP)
- state persistence - save fxp & option
- look again at JACK client osx
- get latency and display
- improve MIDI output timing (portmidi instead of RTMidi?)

IOS wrapper:

- make it work better on device
- see if it works with IOS 5 sdk / float remoteIO
