iplug-todo

ALL - lock free-ness
ALL - GetHostVersionStr() etc are not reliable, especially with AU
ALL - more flexible resource importing (not just png resources)
ALL - improve text entry dimensions / text size
ALL - freetype based font renderer, import .ttf files
ALL - test keyboard input
ALL - drag & drop area
ALL - OS tooltips?
ALL - make consistent code style. tabs/spaces m_blah mBlah etc
ALL - make side chain/multi-channel definitions consistent/easier
ALL - save fxp/fxb with chunks
ALL - carbon non-composited text entry
ALL - set up MSVC projects to handle compilation on x64 or x86 WRT VST3 binary copying, debugging executable etc

Examples:

- IPlugPolySynth
- IPlugDrumSynth
- IPlugMultiChannel
- IPlugOpenGL on win, fix on mac
- IPlugChunks still needs some work
- IPlugControls - some controls not finished

AU wrapper:

- multiple output busess, i.e. for a drumsynth
- sidechain input - seems to kind of work in logic, works in live, not in studio one
- preset changing from inside the plugin doesn't consistently update logic's GUI
- auval "preset name not retained" message
- SendMidiMsg

VST3 wrapper:

- midi output
- pitch bend & other common MIDI CC parameters
- check presets list (doesn't work in S1)
- multi-output

RTAS wrapper:

- chunks
- keycatcher doesn't work (OSX)
- text entries disabled (OSX)
- audiosuite
- presets list
- close session frozen buffer (only happens when debugging?)
- SendMidiMsg/s

Standalone wrapper:

- edit to use IPlugBase buffer attaching code
- some keys not received by windows standalone...arrow keys for example DLGC_WANTARROWS
- how to change audio devices without hanging the main loop?
- change ASIO device fails
- crash with midi on x64??
- sometimes OSX controls need playing with to get the driver to restart
- fade out audio stream when changing settings?
- make it work with no audio input & look at PLUG_IS_INST
- make it work with variable i/o count
- make it work with non-gui plugins
- transport & tempo generator
- missing functions in IPlugStandalone.h
- windows midi - sendmidimsg() crash
- windows midi - MS Built in GS Synth crashes when selected in prefs (XP)
- state persistence - save fxp & option
- look again at JACK client osx
- get latency and display
- improve MIDI output timing (portmidi instead of RTMidi?)

IOS wrapper:

- edit to use IPlugBase buffer attaching code
- make it work better on device
- see if it works with IOS 5 sdk / float remoteIO
