gui:

spectral filter instead of filter, own radiobutton, own filtertype, filteralgo = lp, filterselector (retainer too?)
edit knobs, edit radio button. edit magnitude clipper to have curved clips

add spectral shaper w/ shaping algo selector (+more algo)

+++ try refactoring custom gui

****

spectral clipper with same softening as on magn clipper

cos -> triangle -> something else ... + bias (pos/neg) + (delay shift + feedback)

trying anything with fft 1st audio 2nd visual

augument delay line class to support time (allpass filter interpolation to try instead of linear), smooth change in time, change with repitch. 


comb filter
