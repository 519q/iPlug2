spectral clipper with same softening as on magn clipper

cos -> triangle -> something else ... + bias (pos/neg) + (delay shift + feedback)

trying anything with fft 1st audio 2nd visual

augument delay line class to support time (allpass filter interpolation to try instead of linear), smooth change in time, change with repitch. 


comb filter

phaser


VISUALS: 
shader reacting more to high freqs
----------------
show values and parameter names

shaper bias softer in transition?? 

fix oversampler??
